ðŸŒŸ Day 39 & 40 #100DaysOfCode



Today, I was practicing more on Express.js, a powerful framework for building web applications and APIs with Node.js! Here's a quick rundown of what I learned:

. Routing: Express.js allows you to define routes that handle different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for specific paths. This makes your application structure clear and organized.

. Middleware: Middleware functions act like mini-applications, allowing you to chain them together for pre-processing or post-processing requests before sending responses. This is useful for functionalities like authentication, logging, or parsing data.

. Separation of Concerns: Express.js promotes separating application logic into different modules (like productRoutes.js) for better maintainability and scalability. Each module can handle specific functionalities, like handling product-related routes.



Along with that www.postman.com  allowed me to test my backend efficiently and ensure they were functioning as expected.
